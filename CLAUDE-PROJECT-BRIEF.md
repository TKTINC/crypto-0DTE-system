## Instructions for Claude Code Review

### Getting Started with the Review

To begin your comprehensive review of the Crypto-0DTE System, please download and extract the `crypto-0dte-system-source-only.zip` file from the repository. This archive contains all source code, configuration files, and documentation necessary for a thorough analysis, while excluding build artifacts and dependencies that would complicate the review process.

The archive is organized into logical directories that correspond to the system's microservices architecture. Begin your review with the `README.md` file to understand the overall system structure, then proceed to examine the `backend/` directory for the core application logic, `frontend/` for the user interface implementation, and `terraform/` for the infrastructure configuration.

### Review Prioritization

Given the complexity of the system, please prioritize your review based on the critical path for system functionality and user safety. Start with the core trading logic in the Signal Generation Service and Trading Execution Service, as these components directly handle financial transactions and user funds. Next, examine the security implementation across all components, paying particular attention to authentication, authorization, and data protection mechanisms.

The real-time data processing pipeline should be reviewed for performance and reliability, as any issues in this area could result in missed trading opportunities or incorrect signal generation. Finally, examine the user interface and API design to ensure they provide appropriate functionality and user experience for the target audience.

### Expected Deliverables

Please provide a comprehensive review report that includes an executive summary suitable for business stakeholders, detailed technical findings organized by component and severity, specific code examples demonstrating identified issues, and actionable recommendations for addressing each finding. Include an assessment of the system's overall readiness for production deployment and any critical prerequisites that must be addressed before handling real user funds.

The review should conclude with recommendations for ongoing code quality improvements, suggested architectural enhancements for future development, and guidance on monitoring and maintenance practices that will ensure long-term system reliability and performance.
